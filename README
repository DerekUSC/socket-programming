I have completed all the assignment and show them in terminal
client.cpp: set up the connection between client and aws, send and receieve information
aws.cpp: act as the core of the network, get the information from serverA, serverB and client, send these information to serverC and get the estimation value.
monitor.cpp: monitor all the process
serverA: database
serverB: database
serverC: calculation

client sends link id, file size and signal power to AWS
AWS send these information to monitor
AWS send link_id to serverA/B and receive bandwidth, length, velocity and noise power
AWS send all these information to serverC, which sends back Tt, Tp and delay
AWS send the delay information to monitor and client
